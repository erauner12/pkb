* Docker and Kubernetes: The Big Picture


** Containers: Primer

back in the day one app per server

waste of resources


*** Hello VMWare

get a lot more bang for your buck

instead of one server to one app


Vmware Model

You don't need the whole operating system



*** Containers

container model:

one app per container
-smaller and more efficient


[[file:../images/placeholder.org_20200413_120659_XEaAxi.png]]


The OS steals resources that you could be putting towards your applications

docker image is like a VM template

firing up a container here:

file:../images/placeholder.org_20200413_121531_O59jAB.png


installed this from docker hub and exposed it on a network port




bringing it back up
file:../images/placeholder.org_20200413_121709_J18TF5.png


monolotihic apps everything is backed into a single binary


[[file:../images/placeholder.org_20200413_122002_GAuD3j.png]]


manage services independently
[[file:../images/placeholder.org_20200413_122253_d1CQOy.png]]








*** build a docker container

image is just a stopped container


[[file:../images/kubernetes.org_20200413_124613_GR80VW.png]]

[[file:../images/kubernetes.org_20200413_124644_0h7wPI.png]]

at this point you can run the container like we did earlier




** Kubernetes

*** What is kubernetes

kubernets cares about vs what docker cares about:

[[file:../images/kubernetes.org_20200413_125456_lOL5c7.png]]

docker  = esxi
kubernetes = vcenter


each node is running kubernetes and container runtime ( so that node can run containers)

- docker takes care of the low level stuff and kubernetes controls it all

[[file:../images/kubernetes.org_20200413_125733_k3p9yu.png]]


if your apps are running on-prem, is not difficult to move to the cloud and back if need be:

decouples from where our applications are actually running

[[file:../images/kubernetes.org_20200413_130138_5OG4Qi.png]]

we build a kubernetes cluster to host our applications






*** Docker

docker's goal is to make applications run on containers easily


*** Preparing for containers

Stateless vs Stateful




** Enterprise and Producrtion Readiness

*** Docker

Community Edition and Enterprise Edition


[[file:../images/kubernetes.org_20200413_141601_9UYGuP.png]]

*** Kubernetes

can use on prem and in the cloud

[[file:../images/kubernetes.org_20200413_141847_aW3qDA.png]]

openstack is what Cerner uses


**** Features:

Alpha, Beta, GA
