* Docker and Kubernetes: The Big Picture


** Containers: Primer

back in the day one app per server

waste of resources


*** Hello VMWare

get a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buckget a lot more bang for your buck

instead of one server to one app


Vmware Model


You don't need the whole operating system



*** Containers

container model:

one app per container
-smaller and more efficient




The OS steals resources that you could be putting towards your applications




docker image is like a VM template

firing up a container here:
 


installed this from docker hub and exposed it on a network port




bringing it back up



monolotihic apps everything is backed into a single binary





manage services independently









*** build a docker container

image is just a stopped container




at this point you can run the container like we did earlier




** Kubernetes

*** What is kubernetes

kubernetes cares about vs what docker cares about:



docker  = esxi
kubernetes = vcenter


each node is running kubernetes and container runtime ( so that node can run containers)

- docker takes care of the low level stuff and kubernetes controls it all




if your apps are running on-prem, is not difficult to move to the cloud and back if need be:

decouples from where our applications are actually running



we build a kubernetes cluster to host our applications






*** Docker

docker's goal is to make applications run on containers easily


*** Preparing for containers

Stateless vs Stateful




** Enterprise and Producrtion Readiness

*** Docker

Community Edition and Enterprise Edition




*** Kubernetes

Orchestration


- can use on prem and in the cloud

- we don't make the container bigger
